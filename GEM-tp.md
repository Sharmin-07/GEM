At some point while studying inverse-square laws, I noticed something that felt slightly off—not physically wrong, but structurally uneven.

Newton’s law of gravitation and Coulomb’s law are often presented as mathematical twins: forces proportional to the product of two sources and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. We usually accept this similarity at face value. I did too, until I started paying attention to how the constants in these laws are written.

Coulomb’s law explicitly contains a  \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0}  factor. The appearance of  4\pi  feels natural there—it reflects spherical symmetry and the way a field spreads over the surface of a sphere. Geometry is visible in the equation itself.

In Newton’s law, the same inverse-square dependence appears, but the  4\pi  factor is absent. Instead, everything is absorbed into a single constant,  G . This raised a simple question for me: if the geometric reasoning behind both laws is the same, why does one display it openly while the other hides it?

I tried rewriting Newton’s law in a form closer to Coulomb’s law, explicitly factoring out  4\pi . Doing this led naturally to a constant analogous to permittivity, defined as  \varepsilon_g = \frac{1}{4\pi G} . The point was not to introduce something new, but to see what becomes clearer when the structure is made explicit.

Curious whether this perspective already existed, I found that it does, within a framework known as gravitoelectromagnetism (GEM), where gravitational interactions are written in close analogy with electromagnetism under certain limits.

What interested me most was not the analogy itself, but what it reveals: the way we write physical laws can either expose or conceal their geometric content. Two equations can describe similar physics, yet invite very different ways of thinking simply because of how their constants are arranged.

This exploration grew out of that curiosity—the idea that form matters, and that looking closely at it can change how familiar laws feel.
