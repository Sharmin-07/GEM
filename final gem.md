According to the Newton's Law, the force between two bodies having masses m1 and m2, separated by a distance r is given by _. According to the coulomb's law the forces between two charges is given by _. these two are know to be the analogous. but, there's a difference. In coulomb's law, the constant k is expressed as _, where _ is the electric permittivity of the medium. in other words, the force between two charges depends upon the medium they are placed in. however, that does not happen in newton's law. G is a universal constant, ie, it has the same value everywhere in the universe. that's because when we place a charge in a medium, the particles of that medium form small dipoles, all these same dipoles have the same ef. altogether, the net ef due to this polarisation is always opposite to the external ef. however, when a mass is placed inside a medium, the net gravitational forces due to the particles of the medium is canceled out?

the 1/r squared thing is because of the spherical symmetry. imagine a point mass or a point charge, then another charger or mass placed in
