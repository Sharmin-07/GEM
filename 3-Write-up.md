# Long Version:


According to Newton’s law, the gravitational force between two bodies having masses $m_1$ and $m_2$, separated by a distance r, is given by $G\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}$.
According to Coulomb’s law, the electric force between two bodies having charges $q_1$ and $q_2$, separated by a distance r, is given by $k\frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}$.

Notice the similarity? They both depend inversely on the square of the distance between the masses or charges. But why?

Imagine a point mass or a point charge. It creates an ‘influence’ in its surroundings. This ‘influence’ can be visualized as field lines emerging from (or converging to) the source. The number of these field lines is constant for a given mass or charge, proportional to its magnitude. Consider all points at a distance r from the source — they collectively form a sphere in space. Now, the ‘influence’, that is, the field lines, are uniformly distributed over this sphere. So the force or influence experienced at all points on this sphere is the same.

The larger the surface area, i.e., the greater the value of r, the more points there are for the influence to be spread over. This results in less influence or force per point as r increases. Therefore, we can conclude that the influence or force from the source, at a distance r, is inversely proportional to the surface area of a sphere of radius r.

In other words, the influence experienced per point at a distance r from the source is given by the expression of force. That’s how we can intuitively see why the force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance.

The laws of Newton and Coulomb are often considered analogous — one for gravitation, and one for electrostatics. However, have you noticed the difference between the two laws? The constant in Coulomb’s law is expressed as $\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}$, where $\varepsilon_0$ represents the permittivity of the medium. So, Coulomb’s law becomes $\frac{q_1 q_2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 r^2}$. We can clearly see the $4\pi r^2$ factor in the denominator, as discussed earlier (The surface area of a sphere of radius r is $\frac{q_1 q_2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 r^2}$).

But it’s not the same for Newton’s law — we don’t see the $4\pi r^2$ factor in the denominator. But what if we try to express the constant G in Newton’s law the same way as we expressed the constant in Coulomb’s law? Let’s consider G to be in the form of $\frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_g}$, where $\varepsilon_g$ is the gravitational analogue of electric permittivity in Coulomb’s law. But, correspondingly, does this represent 'gravitational permittivity'?

The term “gravitational permittivity” can sound strange, especially since its electric analogue, electric permittivity, is a property of the medium, and gravitational force is independent of the medium between two bodies. However, this idea actually exists in GEM, which stands for gravitoelectromagnetism.

A natural question arises: why is the electric force dependent on the medium, but not the gravitational force? In the case of electrostatics, the particles of the medium polarize, forming tiny dipoles that oppose the external electric field. These tiny dipoles produce synchronized electric fields, which collectively reduce the net effect of the external field. The greater the electric permittivity of a medium, the stronger the polarization, and the weaker the net external field.

So, in essence, electric permittivity refers to how strongly a medium responds to electric charges. What would gravitational permittivity mean, then? Correspondingly, it would refer to how strongly a medium responds to mass. But that doesn’t make sense, for a simple reason: negative mass doesn’t exist (most likely). So there isn’t a way for mass to polarize in the presence of an external gravitational field. Mass is just mass. Therefore, all media respond in the same way.

Why does this happen? How did we reach a conclusion that seems to suggest the existence of negative mass? It’s simple: the algebra doesn’t know physics. We were comparing the structures of the two laws, which are almost the same, but that doesn’t mean their physics is the same.

Mathematical structures or equations often suggest realities that haven’t been observed yet. Because, again, the algebra doesn’t know physics. These help us understand the physics, even if some concepts don’t exist in reality. However, equations are one of the most beautiful ways to represent nature in a form that can be studied. I believe that.

# Short version:


Newton’s law of gravitation and Coulomb’s law both show an inverse-square dependence on distance. This happens because a mass or charge produces a fixed amount of influence in space.

Think of a point mass or charge. It creates field lines that spread out uniformly in all directions. The total number of these field lines depends only on how much mass or charge there is, so it stays constant. All points at a distance r from the source form a sphere of radius r. As you move farther away, the same number of field lines has to spread over the surface of a larger sphere. Since the surface area increases as  $r^2$ , the influence per point decreases as $1/r^2$ . This is why both forces follow an inverse-square law.

Coulomb’s law includes a permittivity term because electric fields interact with matter: charges in a medium rearrange and reduce the net field. Gravity does not behave this way. Mass cannot rearrange to oppose a gravitational field, so gravitational force remains independent of the medium. This is why Newton’s law lacks a corresponding term, even though its mathematical form resembles Coulomb’s law.
