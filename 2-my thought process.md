While studying inverse-square laws, I noticed something that didn’t seem wrong, but felt uneven in structure.

Newton’s law of gravitation and Coulomb’s law are often said to be analogous because both follow an inverse-square dependence. This is usually accepted without much thought. I did the same, until I started looking more closely at how the constants in these laws are written.

In Coulomb’s law, the constant appears explicitly as $\frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0}$. The presence of the $4\pi r^2$ factor in the denominator of the Coulomb's law makes sense. It reflects spherical symmetry and how an electric field spreads over the surface of a sphere. The geometry is clearly visible in the equation.

In Newton’s law, the same inverse-square dependence exists, but the $4\pi r^2$ factor does not appear explicitly. Everything is absorbed into a single constant, G. This raised a simple question for me: if the geometric reasoning behind both laws is the same, why does one show it clearly while the other hides it?

To explore this, I tried rewriting Newton’s law in a form closer to Coulomb’s law by explicitly expressing G as $\frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_g}$. Doing this naturally leads to a quantity of the form $\varepsilon_g$, which plays a role mathematically similar to electric permittivity. Calling this “gravitational permittivity” immediately feels strange, because gravity is independent of the medium. That made it clear that this is only a formal analogy, not a physical one.

Later, I found that writing gravity in an electromagnetic-like form does exist in a limited and approximate framework called gravitoelectromagnetism (GEM). This confirmed that the analogy itself is not new, but also that it has strict physical limits.

What interested me was not GEM itself, but what this comparison shows about structure. The way we write physical laws can highlight or hide their geometric content. Two laws can have the same mathematical behaviour, yet feel very different simply because of how their constants are arranged.

This write-up came from that observation. The goal was not to introduce a new concept, but to make the structure of Newton’s law as explicit as that of Coulomb’s law, and to understand what is clarified — and what is lost — by doing so.

Note- This repository is not an exploration of gravitoelectromagnetism as a theory. The name is only used because the analogy naturally appears during this comparison, and I could not think of a better title.
