# GEM
We understand the inverse-distance-squared dependence of the Newton's Law and Coulomb's Law for forces due to point masses and point charges, respectively. And, we make an attempt to express one law in the form of the other.

# About Me:-
I'm Sharmin Nabab.
I'm currently a high school student.
My interests span mathematics and physics. I also enjoy coding and am currently learning Python.
I like to break down concepts and rebuild ideas as if explaining to my younger self, often through a first-principles approach.
This space serves as a notebook for my reconstructions and explorations of ideas.
